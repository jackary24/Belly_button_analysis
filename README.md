# Belly Button Analysis

In this module we were tasked with using Plotly to create a number of different charts from provided data. Participants in a research group had their belly buttons swabbed in
order to detect certain kinds of bacteria, with the aim of creating a beef substitute. We were tasked with deploying a web page through Github so participants could see what their
navel contained, and if they were eligible to sell their bacteria to the synthetic beef company. Included was a prebuilt chart holding their basic information, a bar chart showing
the top ten species of bacteria found, a bubble chart showing clusters of species found, ang a gauge chart to show the frequency of washing. Additionally the page was made mobile
responsive, had the banner customized, and reformatted for aesthetic appeal. The page was then launched at the following link.
